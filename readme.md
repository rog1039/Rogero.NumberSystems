## Types of Number Systems

A number system is a combination of an ordered set of symbols:
Alphabet: {s<sup>1</sup>,s2,...sn}

We are converting a number from system X to system Y. The number in system X can be converted to decimal. From this decimal we can reduce to an equivalent number in system Y. System Y can hold r values in each position.
