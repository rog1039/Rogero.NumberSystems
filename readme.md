## Types of Number Systems

A number system is a combination of the following:

**ordered set of symbols:**
Alphabet: {s<sub>1</sub>,s<sub>2</sub>,...s<sub>n</sub>}

**zero collapses**
In typical number systems the zero symbol, s<sub>1</sub>, on the left of a number does not effect its value. For instance, in a decimal based system, 00010 = 10. However, in other number system types, think the column headers in Excel or stadium seating rows, the zero symbol on the left does effect the number. For instance A != AA.

We can break this down by analyzing a given string in a language based on this zero-collapse constraint. In a zero collapse number system with a radix of r<sub>n</sub>, the rightmost digit has _n_ possible values, but subsequent columns only have _r<sub>n</sub>-1_ possible values 




We are converting a number from system X to system Y. The number in system X can be converted to decimal. From this decimal we can reduce to an equivalent number in system Y. System Y can hold r values in each position.
